# 🍽️ Restaurant Menu & Order Analysis 

##  Project Overview
This project applies SQL to analyze restaurant menu and order data with the goal of uncovering actionable business insights. By combining menu information with transactional order data, the analysis explores customer purchasing behavior, item popularity, pricing patterns, and revenue performance. The project is designed to demonstrate strong SQL fundamentals while translating real-world business questions into clear, data-driven findings that can support stakeholder decision-making around menu optimization, pricing strategy, and sales performance.

##  Business Questions
The analysis focuses on answering key business-driven questions, including:

- How many dishes are available in each menu category?
- What are the least and most expensive items on the menu?
- Which menu items are ordered the most and the least?
- Which categories contribute most to order volume?
- How many orders were placed over the available date range?
- Which orders contained the most items?
- How many orders included more than 12 items?
- What were the top 5 highest-spending orders by total revenue?

## Tools Used
- **PostgreSQL** – Data querying and analysis   

Key SQL techniques demonstrated include:
- Table joins (`INNER JOIN`)
- Aggregations (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`)
- Filtering with `WHERE` and `HAVING`
- Sorting and ranking results

## Summary of Insights
Key insights derived from the analysis include:

- A small number of orders contribute disproportionately to overall revenue.
- High-priced menu items are not always the most frequently ordered.
- Certain menu categories drive higher order volumes, while others generate higher revenue per item.
- Large orders (12+ items) are relatively rare but have a significant impact on total sales.
- Identifying both top- and low-performing items provides opportunities for menu optimization and pricing adjustments.

These findings can help stakeholders make informed decisions related to menu design, pricing strategy, inventory planning, and overall business performance.
